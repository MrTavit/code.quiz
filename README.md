# Timed Quiz, built using Vanilla JS

### Welcome to my Timed Quiz. This Quiz was created primarily using Vanilla JS to manipulate the page dynamically.

The goals of this project are as follows:
* Show user a description for the quiz, with a start button
* After the start button is clicked, the first question will show and a timer will start.
* Clicking an answer will display the next question
* If a question is answered incorrectly the timer will be reduced by 15 seconds
* The quiz will play until the timer reaches zero or there are no more questions.
* A game over screen will be shown, with an input box for the users intials
* After submitting their intials, the user will see a high score screen
* The high score screen has a button which will restart the quiz
* And a button which will clear the high score list
